This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The original code has a potential error related to handling empty lists and lists with non-numeric data. The improved version includes robust error handling to address these issues.  The `bug.py` file demonstrates the original function with its limitations, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected, more reliable implementation.
